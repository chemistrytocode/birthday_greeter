# Birthday Greeter

This project was my first attempt at developing a Web Application.

This birthday greeter app allows the end user to enter their name and birthday.
If their Birthday is today's date it sends them a Birthday Greeting, otherwise it tells the user how many days it is until their Birthday.

```
As a user.
So that I can easily check if it's my birthday.
I'd like to enter a name and date and have it return a birthday greeting or a countdown.
```
